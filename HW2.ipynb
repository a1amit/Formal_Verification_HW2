    "\n",
    "Your task is to analyze the transition system generated from the program graph (created in Task 1) and determine **all possible values** the variable `x` may have when the program **terminates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A program execution is considered **terminated** when **all threads have returned to the first step** of their 4-step protocol and **no further transitions are possible** (i.e., the guard `count_i < n_repeats` no longer holds for any thread `i`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def final_x_values(ts: TransitionSystem) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "    return a sorted list of all possible final values of x at program termination.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "The function should return a **sorted list** (from lowest to highest) of all values `x` can take in **terminal states**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Terminal State Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "A state `(location, environment)` is terminal if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The location is `'1' * n_threads` (i.e., all threads are at step 1), **and**\n",
    "- For every thread `i`, the condition `count_i < n_repeats` evaluates to **False** in the given environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should extract the value of `x` from each such terminal environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 🧪 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If `n_threads = 2` and `n_repeats = 2`, the program may terminate in multiple ways, resulting in different possible values of `x`, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the program could terminate with `x in [1, 2, 3, 4]` when all threads complete exactly `2` iterations.\n",
